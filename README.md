# Outlier-Detection-in-Mixed-and-Categorical-Data-Collection

A collection of datasets for outlier detection in mixed and categorical data. Each dataset includes an additional 'is_outlier' column indicating outlier records, designed for research and analysis in anomaly detection.

## Project Description

This repository contains a collection of datasets intended for outlier detection analysis in mixed and categorical data. Each dataset includes an additional column `is_outlier`, which indicates whether a given record was classified as an outlier.

The purpose of this repository is to support research on anomaly detection across various scientific fields, with the option for free use and modification of the data.

## Repository Contents

The repository contains the following folders with datasets:

- `categorical_datasets/`: Contains categorical data
  - `dataset_01_mushroom/`
  - `dataset_02_.../`: (Future datasets will be added here)
  
- `mixed_datasets/`: Contains mixed data (numerical and categorical)
 - `dataset_01_.../`: (Future datasets will be added here)

## Future Additions and Contributions

We plan to continuously expand this repository with new datasets relevant to anomaly detection in various fields. Future datasets will be added to the respective folders.
  
Each dataset includes a `data.csv` file and a `README.md` file detailing the origin, description of variables, and the method used for detecting outliers.

## Dataset Description

### `is_outlier` Column

The datasets in this repository have been processed to detect outliers. The `is_outlier` column contains:

- `1`: The record was classified as an outlier.
- `0`: The record was not classified as an outlier.

### How to Use the Data

To use the data, simply download the CSV files located in the `categorical_datasets` and `mixed_datasets` folders. These datasets can be freely modified and used in research, educational projects, or commercial applications, as long as the licensing conditions are met (see the License section).
